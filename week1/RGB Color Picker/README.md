#  RGB Color Picker

This is my first week's assignment for the RW Bootcamp.  Here a user is able to pick a color either using RGB or HSB pickers.
They are also able set a color with a name and reset all the values.
I decided to have the bacground change dynamically as the user slides through the values.  I have also made it so
the font color of the labels changes depending on how bright the background is
