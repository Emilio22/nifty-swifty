#  RGB Color Picker

This is my first week's assignment for the RW Bootcamp.  Here a user is able to pick a color either using RGB or HSB pickers and set
the background to picked color.
They are also able set a color with a name and reset all the values.
The label above the sliders changes colors as the user adjusts them.  This serves as a preview to what color will be selected.

User can also push an info icon which will load a wiki page for the color patern they are using.
