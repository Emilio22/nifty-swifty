Name: Emilio Rodriguez
Discord: TM: Emilio

## Where
From the United States.  Currently, residing in St. Louis, Missouri.

## Interests / Hobbies
I have many hobbies / interests outside of tech.  Some of my big ones:  
* I am a huge foodie.  Most my life and while in school I have worked in restaurants. The last four years I have been bar
tending and serving in my favorite Restaurants. I love learning about new cuisine and being snobby about wine/beer.
* Proud dog dad
* Mountain Biking / Road Cycling (anything with two wheels)
* I like to run, just recently ran my first half-marathon.

## Goals
My current goal is to take as much in from this boot camp as possible and then find work as a software developer making iOS apps.
I am also trying to run a 5k in under 20 minutes, and later in life I would like to open my own restaurant.
